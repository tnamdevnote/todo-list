# Todo List with React

Demo Link -> [Todo List](https://main--wonderful-stroopwafel-5abf59.netlify.app/) <br>

This is a simple todo list app that helps you manage your daily task. <br>
The purpose of this project is to apply and solidify following concepts that I learned in React:
- Handle CRUD actions using `useReducer`
- Apply dark mode using Context API
- Store and retrieve information from `localStorage`

## Feature
- Add a new task
- Edit/Delete existing task
- Filter todo list by todo state (All/Active/Completed)
- Toggle light/dark mode
  - By default the app will set the mode based on the user device's theme preferences
